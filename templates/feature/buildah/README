This template adds buildah to the image.

buildah is a command line tool that can be used to:
   - create a working container, either from scratch or using an image
     as a starting point
   - create an image, either from a working container or via the
     instructions in a Dockerfile
   - images can be built in either the OCI image format or the
     traditional upstream docker image format
   - mount a working container's root filesystem for manipulation
   - unmount a working container's root filesystem
   - use the updated contents of a container's root filesystem as a
     filesystem layer to create a new image
   - delete a working container or an image
   - rename a local container

Detailed description can be found in the github repository:
https://github.com/containers/buildah

To use the template, add "--templates feature/buildah" as a setup
