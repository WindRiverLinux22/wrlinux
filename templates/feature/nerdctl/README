This template adds nerdctl (Docker-compatible CLI for
containerd) to the filesystem.

The current nerdctl support does not include the following
two aspects:
* build container images on target
* lazy-pulling

To use this template, add the following to your setup line:

    --templates feature/nerdctl

#@TYPE: Wrtemplate
#@NAME: nerdctl
#@DESCRIPTION: Add nerdctl to the image
