This feature enables packages to preserve buildtime.

By default, SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set to the date of the source
code git repo's latest commit of the current branch, or is set
to the date of some specific file such as Changelog. This is a
requirement for reproducible build. See the following links for
more info.
