This template installs systemd-bootchart and boot-tf to the image and generates
bootchart-*.svg and tracing file bootchart-*.json:
- The bootchart-*.svg is saved in /run/log/
- The bootchart-*.json and boot-tf.manifest is saved in /var/lib/tftproot

systemd-bootchart requires a few seconds (usually, about 10 seconds) to
complete the running, and then boot-tf will convert the bootchart-*.svg to
bootchart-*.json.

User can download bootchart-*.json and boot-tf.manifest via:
$ boot-tf -l <addr>
