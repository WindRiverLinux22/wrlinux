This template installs systemd-bootchart and boot-tf to the image and generates
bootchart-*.svg and tracing file bootchart-*.json in /run/log/, the
systemd-bootchart requires a few seconds (usually, about 10 seconds) to
complete the running, and then boot-tf will convert the bootchart-*.svg to
bootchart-*.json.
