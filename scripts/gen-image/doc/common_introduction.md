# Wind River Linux target images

The images are built from Wind River Linux, which support ostree, docker,
kubernetes, xfce and other features in the packages feeds. The images can be
highly customized by package manager dnf, or use the script gen-image to
rebuild them from source.

## Features
Package Manager: dnf
Features: ostree docker kubernetes xfce

### ostree
OSTree is a system for versioning updates of Linux-based operating
systems. It can be considered as "Git for operating system binaries".
It operates in userspace, and will work on top of any Linux file system.
At its core is a Git-like content-addressed object store with branches
(or "refs") to track meaningful file system trees within the store.
Similarly, one can check out or commit to these branches.

#### Ostree Upgrade

  $ ostree_upgrade.sh

This command wraps the ostree admin commands and handles the upgrade
using a single or multi-partition device in order to obtain the
specified branch configured in /sysroot/ostree/repo/config.

  Optional commands:

  -b   reboot after completion
  -e   Erase the /var volume on the next reboot
  -E   FORMAT the /var volume when on a separate partition on the next reboot
  -f   Force /etc to be entirely reset to the initial deploy state
  -r   Redeploy the current branch without doing a network pull
  -s   Skip the fsck integrity checks

  -F   Local Factory reset, uses -b -e -f -r -s
  -U   Factory upgrade reset, uses -b -e -f -s

NOTE: On target, run ostree_upgrade.sh to update the image rather than
'ostree pull'. Use "ostree remote add wrlinux xxx" to add remote repo
if not present.
