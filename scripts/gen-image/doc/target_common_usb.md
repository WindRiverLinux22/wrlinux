Under Linux, insert a micro SD card to a USB SD Card Reader.
Assuming the USB SD Card Reader takes device /dev/sdX, use dd
to copy the image to it. Before the image can be burned onto
a micro SD card, it should be un-mounted. Some Linux distros
may automatically mount when it is plugged in. Using device
/dev/sdX as an example, find all mounted partitions:

    $ mount | grep sdX

and un-mount those that are mounted, for example:

    $ sudo umount /dev/sdX*
